# SNCF bot tickets finder
## You won't have an excuse not to go in vacations (hein, Franï¿½ois ?)



This is a telegram bot made to look wether or not some tickets are available on a given date between 2 stations. In the given code, it is between Saint Vincent de Tyrosse to Paris in France. What I used : 

- [Python Telegram Bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
- Inspired from : [Trainline Python](https://github.com/tducret/trainline-python)
- Magic :star:

## Notes :

Because, of course, Trainline isn't happy with that, I removed the headers from my code so that people cannot just use it right away. If you want to get the headers that need to be used for it to work, please contact me.
